intended v1.1.1
+ Publish in npm as "store" rather than "store.js"
+ Add commonjs export for require support

v1.1.0
+ First versioned version.
+ API: store.set, store.get, store.remove, store.clear, store.transact
+ Minified versions are included: store.min.js for store.js only, and store+json2.min.js for store.js and json2.js

TODO
- Get around IE6/7 per-directory restrition. @lrbabe/@louis_remi had the idea of putting the store.js API in an anonymous iframe a la https://github.com/meebo/embed-code and see what directory restriction that would fall under
